# Redis Lock for Lambdas üóùÔ∏è

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/everson1234567/redislock?color=blue&label=Latest%20Release)

Redis Lock for Lambdas is a pure Python library that provides a distributed locking mechanism using the Redis Protocol. This library is ideal for scenarios where multiple concurrent AWS Lambda executions need to ensure that certain tasks are performed exclusively by a single instance. It supports configurable TTL, backoff strategies, customizable timeouts, time zone settings, and includes a built-in Redis client.

## Features

- **Distributed Locking**: Ensures that only one Lambda function instance can execute a specific task at a time.
- **Configurable TTL**: Set the time-to-live for locks to manage how long a lock should be held.
- **Backoff Strategies**: Automatically manage retries with backoff intervals to avoid contention.
- **Customizable Timeouts**: Adjust the timeout settings to fit your needs.
- **Time Zone Support**: Manage locks across different time zones.
- **Built-in Redis Client**: Simplifies connection and interaction with Redis.

## Installation

To install Redis Lock for Lambdas, you can use pip. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install redislock
```

Ensure that you have Python and pip installed on your machine. If you do not have Redis set up, follow the official Redis documentation to install it.

## Usage

Here‚Äôs a basic example of how to use Redis Lock for Lambdas in your Python code:

```python
from redislock import RedisLock

def my_lambda_function(event, context):
    lock = RedisLock('my_lock_key')

    if lock.acquire():
        try:
            # Your task logic here
            print("Task is being executed exclusively.")
        finally:
            lock.release()
    else:
        print("Could not acquire lock, task is skipped.")
```

In this example, the `my_lambda_function` attempts to acquire a lock before executing its task. If it cannot acquire the lock, it will skip the task.

## Configuration

You can configure the Redis Lock settings to fit your requirements. Here are some common configurations:

```python
lock = RedisLock(
    key='my_lock_key',
    ttl=60,  # Time-to-live in seconds
    backoff=2,  # Backoff strategy in seconds
    timeout=10,  # Timeout for lock acquisition in seconds
    tz='UTC'  # Time zone
)
```

### Key Parameters

- **key**: The unique key for the lock.
- **ttl**: Time-to-live for the lock.
- **backoff**: The time to wait before retrying to acquire the lock.
- **timeout**: The maximum time to wait for the lock.
- **tz**: The time zone to use for the lock.

## Examples

### Basic Example

Here‚Äôs a simple example demonstrating the basic functionality:

```python
from redislock import RedisLock

def my_task():
    lock = RedisLock('my_task_lock')

    if lock.acquire():
        try:
            print("Executing task...")
            # Perform your task here
        finally:
            lock.release()
    else:
        print("Task is already running.")
```

### Advanced Example with Custom Configuration

In this example, we configure the lock with custom settings:

```python
from redislock import RedisLock

def my_advanced_task():
    lock = RedisLock(key='advanced_task_lock', ttl=120, backoff=5, timeout=15)

    if lock.acquire():
        try:
            print("Executing advanced task...")
            # Perform your advanced task here
        finally:
            lock.release()
    else:
        print("Could not acquire lock for advanced task.")
```
